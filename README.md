# Game Developer Diversity
Our goal is to help game companies to release their diversity information so we can have a conversation about the state of equitable representation in the games industry.

## Contributing
Do you know a company that has released their diversity information or something on here is wrong? Please submit a pull request.

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). To update this site, install hugo, and run: `hugo.exe server -w` on the command line from the gamedevdiversity folder.
This will get you a site that will live-update locally and you can test your changes that way.
